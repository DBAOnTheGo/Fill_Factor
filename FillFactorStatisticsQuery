Desc: Builds out a suggestion based on the max record size divided by the usable space on a page.
--8096 is the true usable space, but 8060 was used to give a little bit of buffer.
--Please ignore the strange math. If anyone knows a better way to pull a % out of this, I will gladly update my code and give credit. 
--Please do not change all your fill factors based on this. This is for exploritory uses only.
--The script is only built to show what fill factor % would need to be used to allow for an additional single record to be placed in the page.
